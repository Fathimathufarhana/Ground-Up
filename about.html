            <p>As such, when the Psychotherapist is emergent, intra-relational, feeling lead and attends to the here and
                now, the client benefits greatly from the cohesion between their Non ordinary experience and
                Psychotherapeutic approach, furthering both the depth of Non ordinary experience and breadth of
                integration.</p><br><br>
            <h3>What is top down processing and what is Bottom up Processing?</h3><br><br>
            <p>To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are
                important” bottom up processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The
                latter is the expression of an internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths
                match the phenomenological truths which emerge in Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is
                so important to support.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Who is this training for?</h3><br><br>
            <p>This training is for Mental Health practitioners interested in the field of PAP and well as practitioners
                who are already working in the field looking to develop their skills and orientation in PAP. Ground up
                module 1 is for any practitioner wanting to, or currently working in this field who is looking to
                further integrate their approach into an experience lead, felt lead approach to PAP . This training is
                also for mental health practitioners who may feel the training they have received is in some way limited
                or incomplete. <br><br>

                In some instances, this training is also suitable for those in training to become Mental Health
                Practitioners. <br><br>
